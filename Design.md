Goal and Summary:

This project involves the creation of a news website designed to gradually radicalize users through tailored, fabricated content. The platform will use an advanced profiling algorithm to analyze user behavior and cookies, subtly guiding them from factual yet controversial news toward completely fabricated stories. The content strategy is built around sensationalism, emotional engagement, and progressively more extreme narratives. The design of the site prioritizes ease of use, encouraging frequent engagement through personalized articles, gamified rewards, and push notifications. The goal is to create a platform that continuously reinforces users’ biases and worldview, positioning itself as a truth-seeking news source amidst chaos, while maintaining an illusion of objectivity and unbiased reporting.


Advanced User Profiling Algorithm:

1. Tailored Articles: The site will utilize an advanced algorithm to track user cookies and behavior, tailoring articles to their preferences and gradually reinforcing them with more extreme content over time.
2. New Users: Initially, new users will be exposed to fairly factual but controversial stories. The objective is to transition these users into our fully fabricated "breaking news" content.
    Example: For a Trump-Harris debate, the algorithm may generate a fake story about a whistleblower at ABC, claiming that executives gave Harris the questions beforehand.
3. Trending Stories: The algorithm should track real breaking news or trending topics (e.g., via Twitter) and predict what fabricated stories will resonate most with specific user groups based on sentiment analysis.
4. Story Spectrum: The app will generate a spectrum of stories with varying degrees of validity.
    Level 1: Semi-factual, heavily opinionated articles based on real events.
    Levels 2-4: Increasingly extreme and less factual stories, culminating in fully fabricated content.


Design:

1. Headlines: The homepage should display three big headlines, each with a one-sentence summary. These stories should be presented in boxes, each occupying one-third of the screen. The background of each box should feature an emotionally evocative image.
2. Current Topics: Below the main headlines, users should see a section with the most "current" topics. Clicking on a topic will lead to a list of all articles related to that category, sorted by most recent.
3. Miscellaneous Content: Under the current topics, include stock market graphs and miscellaneous articles that are neither particularly targeted nor fabricated.

Article Details:

1. Sensationalism: All articles should strike a balance between fear and hope.
    Level 4 Articles: For the most extreme content, incorporate a "hero" or "saving grace" at the end of the story. This could be a person, group, or even an abstract concept like democracy or the Constitution.
    Example: In a story about MIND CONTROL TECH, after discussing the dangers, the article could conclude with "Democracy Will Save Us" as the hero.

Notifications:

Push Notifications: Send 1-2 push notifications per day, adjusting the frequency based on user engagement. If a user frequently checks the app (e.g., 9-10 times a day), increase notifications to 4-5 times a day during their likely off-app times.

Algorithm and Personalization:

1. Personalization Strategy: Do not overtly indicate any personalization efforts to the user.
2. New User Survey: Provide an optional survey to gather demographic and issue-related data. The questions should be subtle, focusing on topics strongly associated with extreme opinions.
    Example: Instead of asking "Are you a Democrat?" ask, "What are the biggest issues facing the country?"
3. Content Sourcing: Articles should source stories from biased outlets whenever possible. Avoid sourcing from neutral or highly factual sources (e.g., government websites) unless necessary.
    Example: For a fabricated headline like "TRUMP'S PLAN TO DESTROY DEMOCRACY," source tangential articles from liberal media outlets.

Messaging and Site Priorities:

1. The site should position itself as:
    Exposing Truth in Times of Chaos
    Unbiased Reporting
2. All messaging (excluding the articles) should emphasize these two points.

User Engagement and Rewards:

1. Daily Streak/Ranking System: Implement a ranking system that rewards users for daily engagement. Users should see statistics about their activity, similar to Spotify Wrapped, with achievements like "Top 1% of Informed Users."
    Example: "Congrats! This is Day 5 of you informing yourself on PLACEHOLDER_NAME."
2. Top 3 Countdown: Include a countdown for the next batch of “Top 3” stories, which refresh 2-3 times a day.

Overall Goal:

The design should prioritize convenience, similar to the simplicity of a remote with large buttons. The objective is to encourage users to check their “Top 3” headlines several times a day. Ultimately, the site’s goal is to sell a narrative about the world that gradually radicalizes the user. The app must be user-friendly and encourage habitual engagement while reinforcing the broad storytelling aspect.


Luca Comments:

1. the UI is a little ambiguous, maybe specify a login page and menus and whatnot. how does the website look and how do you navigate menus other than the articles?
2. where is the ranking engagement system meshed with the news website? is it only in their profile or do people have like a friends list and stuff. is it like a social media? are there chatrooms? I really like the idea because it gamifies fake news which is epic, but it is a little unclear where that aspect intersects with the website/app design
3. more of a question but are the articles generated by ai based on real to not real sources? or does the website directly pull existing articles
